**This is a binding contract.  Please read it carefully before using the Aptible Security Assessment Questionnaire offering.**

These Supplemental Terms of Service for the Security Assessment Questionnaire Offering (“Supplemental Terms”) are an important contract between You and Us, and provide for rights and obligations with respect to Your use of the SAQ Offering (as further defined) only.

The rights and obligations provided for in these Supplemental Terms are in addition to—not instead of—the rights and obligations provided for in the Aptible Terms of Service and its Policies (as defined therein), available at https://www.aptible.com/legal/terms-of-service (such Terms of Service and Policies, together, the “General Terms”, and together with the Supplemental Terms, the “Terms”), which are hereby incorporated by reference, and which also govern your use of the SAQ Offering.

**You acknowledge and agree these Supplemental Terms form an integral part of the General Terms, and that by agreeing to these Supplemental Terms, you are also agreeing to the General Terms.**  In the event of explicit conflict between these Supplemental Terms and the General Terms, these Supplemental Terms shall govern.

- "Aptible," "We," "Us," and “Our” means Aptible Inc.
- “You,” and “Your” refer to you in your individual capacity, or, if your access is being made on behalf of your organization, your organization and all of its users or end users.  
- The "SAQ Offering" means an administrative product/service offering to expedite Your responses to security questionnaires posed by Your prospective customers (the “Security Assessment Questionnaire”, or “SAQ”), by pre-populating a first draft of Your responses to those SAQs based on information provided by You, for Your review and confirmation.
