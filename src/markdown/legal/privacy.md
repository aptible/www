Version 3.2 – August 28, 2019

At Aptible, our core mission is to help teams protect data on the internet. As a result, our goal is to set a high standard for protecting the privacy of your information. We want to be clear about how we collect, use, protect, and share your information, including your personal information, and the rights and choices you have about the ways in which you can help us protect your privacy.

This Privacy Statement explains:

  * What information we collect and why we collect it.

  * How we use that information and when we disclose it.

  * Your rights regarding that information, including how to access and update your information.

  * The steps we take to protect your information.

**Scope:** This Privacy Statement applies to the information that we obtain through your use of Aptible products and services, including our website ([https://www.aptible.com][0]), our Deploy and Comply platforms, social media, communications, and web-based tools (collectively, our "Services"). For a current list of the Services and vendors covered by this Privacy Statement, see our [Subvendor Directory][9].

This Privacy Statement does not apply to personal information arising from Aptible’s employment-related activities. Except to the extent that a third party provides services on our behalf (such as a SaaS vendor), this Privacy Statement also does not apply to the practices of third parties to which we may link or otherwise refer you, such as consultants, pen testing firms, audit firms, and other vendors.

**Geography:** Aptible is a U.S.-based company that offers our Services to domestic and international business customers. As a result, information that we collect, including personal information, may be transferred to our U.S. offices to permit us to comply with our legal and contractual obligations, to provide information and services to prospective and current clients, and to perform related business activities. In addition, we may provide information to third-party service providers in the U.S. and in other countries to the extent necessary to support Aptible’s business activities, and we may access personal information collected by our customers to support the Services that we provide to our customers. Thus, personal information may be transferred to and stored on servers located in the United States and in countries different from the country in which that information was initially collected. Similarly, information we collect may be accessed by Aptible and our third-party service providers and business partners from countries other than the ones in which the information is stored. For more information about how we handle personal information from EU-based individuals, see below.

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Statement or about our privacy or data security practices, please contact us at legal@aptible.com.

# Information that We Collect from and About You

## Information that You Provide to Us Voluntarily

**Account and Profile Information:** We collect information about you and your company when you register for an account, create or modify your profile, and make purchases through our Services. Information we collect includes your name, username, address, email address, phone number, and payment card details. You may provide this information directly through our Services or in some cases another user (such as an account administrator) creating an account on your behalf may provide it. If you provide information (including personal information) about someone else, you confirm that you have the authority to act for them and to consent to the collection and use of their personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Content:** We collect and store content that you create, input, submit, post, upload, transmit, or store while using our Services. Such content may include any personal or other sensitive information submitted using our Services, such as HIPAA protected health information, EU personal data, and other information such as source code or regulatory compliance materials. When we process HIPAA protected health information or EU personal data on your behalf pursuant to a HIPAA business associate agreement or a GDPR data protection agreement, our use of that data is restricted by that agreement and limited solely to providing you with our Services and other ancillary functions as provided by law.

**Other submissions:** We collect other data that you may submit to our Services or to us directly, such as when you request customer support or communicate with us via email or social media sites.

## Information that We Collect Automatically When You Use Our Services

**Web Logs and Analytics Information:** We record certain information and store it in log files when you interact with our Services. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) or other device addresses or ID numbers as well as browser type, Internet service provider, URLs of referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, information that you search for, your locale and language preferences, your mobile carrier, and system configuration information. We and our analytics providers (see our [Subvendor Directory][9]), also collect and store analytics information when you use our Services to help us improve our Services.

**Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:** We use various technologies to collect information, including cookies that we save to your computer or mobile device. See our [Subvendor Directory][9].  Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory. We use cookies to improve and customize our Services and your experience; to allow you to access and use the Services without re-entering your username or password; and to count visits and understand which areas and features of the Services are most popular. We may also associate the information we store in cookies with personal information you submit while on our Services. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of our Services.

# Information that We Collect from Other Sources

**Information from third parties:** We may obtain information, including personal information, from our business partners and service providers. This information includes, but is not limited to, information that we receive from our direct marketing providers, product referrals, and other interactions. We also may combine information we receive from third parties with other information we collect from you through our Services as described in this Privacy Statement. If we use this information to provide you with opportunities that we think may be of interest to you, you will have the ability to inform us that you do not wish to receive such offers, and you may unsubscribe from our marketing and other email communications by clicking on the link in the email, sending an e-mail to [legal@aptible.com][1], or accessing your user account and changing your distribution preferences.

 

**Information provided by other individuals:** While using our Services, individuals may provide information about another individual, or an authorized user (such as an account administrator) creating an account on your behalf may provide information about You. When one individual provides us with information (including personal information) about another individual, we assume that the individual has permission and authority to do so and to consent on behalf of that individual to the collection and use of personal information as described in this Privacy Statement. Please contact us immediately at [legal@aptible.com][1] if you become aware of an individual providing us with personal information about another individual without being authorized to do so, and we will act consistently with this Privacy Statement.

 

## Information that We Receive About You From Our Customers

Our customers and their designated users use our Services, in particular Deploy, to develop, establish, implement, and maintain secure application and database deployment environments for processing sensitive data, including personal information and sensitive personal information. While using our Services, our customers may create, input, submit, post, upload, transmit, or store personal information that they have collected from individuals. During the course of our business relationship, we may need to access a customer’s account and the information it contains to provide support for our Services. 

 

Our customers and prospective customers are responsible for complying with all applicable federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations regarding notice, disclosure, consent, and transfer of personal information, prior to providing that personal information to Aptible.

Unlike the other collections of information described in this section, our agreements with customers include specific protections and limitations regarding our access to and use of personal information collected by customers, and we do not access, use, copy, retain, or aggregate that customer data except as stated in those agreements.

# When and Why We Share or Disclose Personal Information

Except to the extent necessary to fulfill our business obligations, to accomplish one of the lawful purposes described in this Privacy Statement, or pursuant to your express instructions, we do not sell, transfer, or otherwise disclose personal information that we collect from or about you. 

We may share your information in the following ways:

**With your express consent:** We will share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals  outside of Aptible when we have your consent to do so.

**When you choose to directly share your information while using our Services:** When you use our Services, certain features allow you to make some of your content accessible to the public or other users of the Services. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information prior to sharing it publicly or with other users.

We provide your payment information to our service providers for payment processing and verification. Service providers such as analytics providers may collect information about your online activities over time and across different online services [PM13] when you use our Services.

  * To investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations.

 

**As the result of a business transition:** We may share or transfer your information (including your personal information) in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company. We will take reasonable steps to assure that any other entity involved continues to comply with the terms of this Privacy Statement. We will notify you of such a change in ownership or transfer of assets by posting a notice on our website.

 

**Sharing aggregate, anonymized, deidentified, or otherwise non-personal data:** We may share aggregate, anonymized deidentified, or otherwise non-personal information that does not directly or indirectly identify you and that cannot, with reasonable effort, be used to reidentify you in order to improve the overall experience of our Services. Such aggregated, anonymized, deidentified, or otherwise not re-identifiable information is not personal information within the scope of this Privacy Statement.

  * You may update or correct your personal information at any time by accessing the account settings page on the website or within our platform.

# Security

 

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. That said, we certainly try very hard, employing a variety of organizational, technical and administrative measures to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk associated with the personal information you trust us with. 

To that end, we manage our data protection program consistent with ISO 27001, SOC 2, HITRUST, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements such as HIPAA and GDPR.

  * Aptible’s ISO 27001 certification for Deploy and Comply is available [here](/compliance/iso-27001-certification/).

  * Aptible’s HITRUST CSF stand-alone certification letter is available [here](/compliance/hitrust-csf-certification/).

  * Aptible’s current SOC 2 Type 2 report and HITRUST CSF Validated Assessment Report are available under NDA to customers only (please contact [support@aptible.com][2] for copies)

Please see our [Security Policy][3] for more details.

Aptible protects personal information under its control, and requires its service providers (see our [Subvendor Directory][9]) to also protect against, accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or access to, personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed. 

If you have concerns about the security of your information with Aptible, please contact us immediately at [security@aptible.com][4] to report an issue.

  

# Data Retention

We retain your personal information only as long as necessary to accomplish the business purpose for which it was collected or to comply with our legal and contractual obligations, plus 1 year, and then securely disposes of that information.

# Children’s Privacy

Our Services are not directed to individuals under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at [legal@aptible.com][1].

# California Privacy Rights

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits Aptible customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us at [legal@aptible.com][1].

 

# Information for International Users

The core Deploy and Comply APIs are hosted in the United States. You may choose to run Deploy stacks in non-U.S. regions, such as the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law. Please note that when you use the core Deploy and Comply APIs, you are transferring your information outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing. By providing your information, you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with this Policy.

# Information for EU-Based Individuals: EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Compliance

Aptible, Inc. is a participant in the U.S. Department of Commerce’s EU-U.S. Privacy Shield program, and has certified that we adhere to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles. Aptible is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. For more information about the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, visit the [U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website][5].

## EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Onward Transfers

For personal data transferred from the EU to the U.S. or other third country not determined to meet EU adequacy requirements, if we transfer your personal data to a third party, we will ensure that the third party is contractually obligated to process your data only for limited, specific purposes consistent with this policy. We will also ensure that the third party will apply the same level of protection to that data as the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles and will notify us if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet this obligation. Aptible may be potentially liable if these requirements are not met.

## Complaints, Questions, and Arbitration

In compliance with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles, we strive to resolve all complaints about privacy and the collection or use of customer information. If you have questions about our participation in the Privacy Shield programs or have a complaint, please send an e-mail to [legal@aptible.com][1]. 

Under the Privacy Shield programs, any unresolved privacy complaints can be referred to an independent dispute resolution mechanism. We use the International Centre for Dispute Resolution®/American Arbitration Association®. If you feel that we have not satisfactorily addressed your complaint, you can visit the ICRD/AAA website at [https://apps.adr.org/webfile/][6]

for more information on how to file a complaint. In some cases, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration.
