### Support Business Hours
Normal Aptible business hours are 9am-6pm Eastern.

### Deprecation
We will announce if we intend to discontinue or make backwards incompatible changes to any Service. We will always try to give you as much time as possible to make any necessary modifications to your applications or processes. This policy does not apply to versions, features, and functionality that we label as "beta" or "experimental."

### Documentation
We may provide documentation for the Services and their use. Our documentation may specify restrictions on how Applications may be built or configured, or how Services must be configured. You agree to comply with any such restrictions as specified. Visit [https://www.aptible.com/documentation](/documentation/) for access to our support and documentation resources.

### End User Support
You are responsible for providing customer service (if any) to End Users. We do not provide any support or services to End Users unless we have a separate agreement with you or an End User for the provision of such services.

### Monitoring
Aptible's systems are continuously monitored by automated systems and health checks. In the event of any issue that adversely affects the performance, security, reliability, or integrity of the Services, we will receive notification and respond immediately. Check [http://status.aptible.com](http://status.aptible.com) for the current status of our services.
