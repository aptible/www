            <p>
              Companies that pursue compliance programs like SOC 2 and ISO 27001
              need to distribute that documentation to their sales prospects in
              a secure, confidential way.
            </p>
            <p>
              Distribution processes like getting an NDA in place, watermarking
              reports, and creating an audit record of distribution are
              fragmented across sales, security, legal, and customer success,
              and systems like Docusign, email, Jira, and Salesforce.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each manual step needed to fulfill a request slows down the sales
              cycle.

            tickets, sign NDAs, and watermark SOC 2 reports.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every customer request is slowed down by the need to be answered,
            recorded, relayed and fulfilled by a team member.

            business at the customer or deal level.
