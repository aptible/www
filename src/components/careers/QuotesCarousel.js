Folks here are thoughtful in their approach to things, from ‘How will what I say land on the other person?’ to ‘How will this architectural decision limit the flexibility of our product a year from now?’. And yet, we’re still biased toward action: My teammates have an amazing energy around getting stuff done. Lastly, I admire my colleagues’ grit: When we set our mind to something, nothing gets in our way."
